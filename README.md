CyberDefenseScenario
====================

The Cyber Defense Scenario is an EDURange exercise intended to emulate the general rules and environment at regional Collegiate Cyber Defense Competitions (CCDC). At CCDC, students are formed into teams of 8 to defend a network  of various services most often including at least a web site of some kind (and to preform the duties of a generic IT dept), Computer Security professionals are formed into red teams and are let loose at attacking the various blue team networks. During this process the blue team is also expected to preform various relatively trivial functions for the other hypothetical departments in their 'company'.

This repository currently only contains the code for some of the scoring programs, the blue team's website and database.
